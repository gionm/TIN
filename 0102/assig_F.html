	<h1 class="fh">Pop art</h1>
	<div class="f">
     <p class="fp">The Pop art is an artistic movement born in the United Kingdom and the United States in the late ' 50s and early' 60s . This movement is an expression of society and the collective imagination, and it is an art aimed at the mass and not at the single individual. The artists are inspired by everyday objects, for example television, refrigerator, poster, washing machine, car, cans or newspaper magazines [1] and depict them in their works by removing them from their natural environment and isolating them. The works of this movement are nothing more than commercial products.
	    The main artists of this current are Andy Warhol , Roy Lichtenstein , Claes Oldenburg , Richard Hamilton , Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns.

	<h1 class="sh">Origin and social context</h1>
	<div class="s">
     <p class="sp">This artistic movement developed in the Western world after the war. In that period new objects come into play that had not existed until that moment, immediately becoming part of the life of man, who can no longer do without them. For example, these items are utility cars, posters, refrigerators, washing machines, canned food, detergents and packaged drinks. All these objects become the new symbols of the consumer society in which Pop art was born. Unlike the other artistic movements that developed in this period such as the phenomenon of Happening and New Dada, Popular Art moves away from any form of criticism and focuses only on showing reality.
				   Therefore the urban environment in which this new form of expression develops is an environment characterized by the psychology of waste and consumption that lead to the change of the social structure in industrialized countries where a mass culture is developing and in fact the works are nothing more than commercial products. The artists of this movement turn to the universe of the great modern metropolises and move within the urban scene, considered as a visual spectacle. The city where Pop art was born is an aggressive city, full of contradictions and bad things. However, for the Pop artist this model of city assumes a lively and familiar role which he cannot give up.
				   We can define this artistic current as realistic art, where the artist tries to reproduce a modern realism taking into account the transformations of the environment. In the fifties of the twentieth century, the French scholar Roland Barthes affirms that the press and society through the communication of the mass media attribute a reassuring value in the collective consciousness through objects that convey serenity and that are subjected to a process of veneration and argues that everything what creates insecurity should be removed. At the same time, the thought of Marshall McLuhan develops, who argued that in the evolution of communication the mass media would be fundamental and affirms that it is precisely the artists who must conceive the changes.

	<h1 class="th">Techniques and themes</h1>
	<div class="t">
     <p class="tp">The artists of pop art is questioned on the problem of reproducibility of art in the industrial era, how and whether to maintain the unique character of the work of art, or do they reconcile the reality of consumerism with its own language. From the different answers given to these questions, the diversity of styles and techniques typical of pop art was born. On the one hand, artistic creation became mechanical, on the other the lessons of the main avant-gardes of the twentieth century were recovered: from the provocations of Dadaism which first mixed art and reality, to photo collages or advertising images with a still cubist flavor, up to happenings or theatrical gestures, in which the artist creates the work of art directly in front of the spectators, leaving room for improvisation.
				   The main theme of Pop art is the existential anguish of the consumer society, in which man represents the consumer. The artist's interest is aimed at images and depictions of man's daily life and the artificial world in which he lives made up of infinite industrial products of common use and mass media (TV, radio ...) . The works show a colorful world, full of joy that actually hides the anxiety and anguish that is eclipsed behind the full and lively colors. The subject of representation becomes the urban environment, so we find images from television, cinema and advertising that are represented through painting and sculpture.
				   Artists transform any aspect of modern reality characterized by the mass media into art, and it is precisely from the union of art with the latter that pop art is born. In their works, pop artists never let a personal judgment leak out. As we have already said, Pop artists often represent photographs or reproductions of material obtained from the mass media, therefore they subtract the various codes and mechanisms to represent them through art from the behavior of society. It is important to remember that this artistic current is characterized by different styles which are addressed in the study of various elements: 
				   <ul class="tu"><li>Photo
				   <li>Reworking of advertising images
				   <li>Comics
				   <li>Performances and improvisations, where the artist creates his works in front of his spectators</ul>

	<h1 class="qh">Italian pop art</h1>
	<div class="q">
     <p class="qp">In Italy Pop art developed thanks to the arrival of works by American pop artists at the contemporary exhibition of the Venice Biennale, despite some critics against it accusing it of containing "the seeds of a new fascism" [6] . Rome is the city where this artistic movement develops precisely due to the close contact with the American capital. And it is precisely in Rome that in 1959, Cy Twombly stops and settles , very attached to pop art in the United States even if he himself does not join the movement.
